    <p>
      In January 2026, the research group recorded several notable academic outcomes with three research manuscripts accepted for presentation at international and national conferences in the fields of artificial intelligence and computational intelligence. These achievements reflect the group’s ongoing research efforts spanning medical image analysis, topological data analysis, and time-series forecasting.
    </p>

    <p>
      On 09 January 2026, the manuscript <strong>A Novel Zigzag-Persistence-Based Framework for Topology-Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting</strong> was accepted for presentation at the 2nd International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Engineering Science (ICCIES 2026), an international conference to be held on 02–04 April 2026 in Vietnam. The study proposes a topology-enhanced forecasting framework that integrates zigzag persistence with deep learning to capture dynamic structural evolution in time-series data.

    <p>
      On 30 January 2026, the paper <strong>Hotspot Detection on Distribution-Mapper Graphs</strong> was accepted by the 2026 FISU Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (FJCAI 2026), a national conference scheduled for 27–28 March 2026 in Vietnam. The work introduces a distribution-guided Mapper approach designed to improve the stability and effectiveness of hotspot detection in high-dimensional datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, the manuscript <strong>A CNN–Vision Transformer Hybrid Framework for Brain Tumor MRI Image Classification</strong> was accepted for presentation at FJCAI 2026, a national conference. This study presents a hybrid CNN–Vision Transformer architecture for brain tumor classification from MRI images and reports strong experimental performance on a large public medical imaging dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, these activities highlight the group’s sustained research productivity and its active engagement with both international and national academic venues, contributing to the advancement of artificial intelligence methodologies and their applications in data-driven analysis and healthcare.

      As part of its applied research activities, the AMaDaS (Applied Mathematics and Data Science) Research Group of Tien Giang University has established a research collaboration with Tien Giang General Hospital and Dong Thap General Hospital to investigate the development of artificial intelligence (AI)–based models for supporting breast cancer diagnosis using medical imaging data.
      Within this collaboration, the AMaDaS group conducts research on the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for medical image analysis, focusing on feature extraction and model construction to support breast cancer screening and diagnostic processes. The study aims to explore the feasibility of AI-assisted diagnostic support systems that can enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical practice.
