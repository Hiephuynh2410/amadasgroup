        As part of its applied research activities, the AMaDaS (Applied Mathematics and Data Science) Research Group of Tien Giang University has established a research collaboration with Tien Giang General Hospital and Dong Thap General Hospital to investigate the development of artificial intelligence (AI)–based models for supporting breast cancer diagnosis using medical imaging data.

        Within this collaboration, the AMaDaS group conducts research on the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for medical image analysis, focusing on feature extraction and model construction to support breast cancer screening and diagnostic processes. The study aims to explore the feasibility of AI-assisted diagnostic support systems that can enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in clinical practice.
