  <h2>Research Vision and Mission</h2>

  <p>
    The primary mission of the <strong>Applied Mathematics and Data Science Research Group (AMaDaS)</strong>
    is to advance rigorous and impactful research at the intersection of applied mathematics
    and data-driven methodologies.
  </p>

  <ul style="margin: 16px 0 16px 20px; line-height: 1.8;">
    <li>Develop <strong>mathematically grounded models</strong> for modern data analysis problems</li>
    <li>Bridge <strong>theoretical mathematics</strong> with <strong>data science, machine learning, and AI</strong></li>
    <li>Promote <strong>reproducible, interpretable, and reliable</strong> computational methods</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The group places strong emphasis on <strong>model interpretability</strong>,
    <strong>robustness</strong>, and <strong>generalization</strong>, ensuring that research outcomes
    are not only performant but also scientifically meaningful.
